Ask Twilia - Automated Sentiment Analysis
================

 Welcome to Ask Twilia! This is a [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com) demo, that integrates automated sentiment analysis through [Tweetsentiment](https://www.tweetsentimentapi.com) with programmable sms.

 Ask Twilia provides you the service of a good friend. She lends you a neutral set of eyes to find out what to take from his last sms.

This is built using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com), hosted on [Heroku](https://gentle-woodland-7180.herokuapp.com), and uses [memcachier](http://memcachier.com) and [dalli](https://github.com/mperham/dalli) to cache responses.
